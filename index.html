          <p>With the advance of artificial intelligence (AI), the emergence of Google Gemini and OpenAI Q* marks the direction towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). To implement AGI, the concept of interactive AI (IAI) has been introduced, which can interactively understand and respond not only to human user input but also to dynamic system and network conditions. In this article, we explore an integration and enhancement of IAI in networking. We first comprehensively review recent developments and future perspectives of AI and then introduce the technology and components of IAI. We then explore the integration of IAI into the next-generation networks, focusing on how implicit and explicit interactions can enhance network functionality, improve user experience, and promote efficient network management. Subsequently, we propose an IAI-enabled network management and optimization framework, which consists of environment, perception, action, and brain units. We also design the pluggable large language model (LLM) module and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) module to build the knowledge base and contextual memory for decision-making in the brain unit. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework through case studies. Finally, we discuss potential research directions for IAI-based networks.

      <h2 class="title">Tutorial with an Example</h2>
      <div class="content has-text-justified">
        <p>
          In this part, we  show a step-by-step tutorial by using our IAI. <br>

          Our consists of the following units <br>


{\bf Perception:} The Perception component of the IAI-enabled problem formulation framework is akin to human sensory reception, drawing from diverse sources and modalities. This multi-modal approach enables the IAI to assimilate information from text, visuals, and numerical data. Upon receiving this data, the system employs prompt engineering to transform raw information into structured embeddings. These embeddings are designed to encapsulate the complexity of the input data in a format that is readily interpretable by the IAI agents. Consequently, the Perception component prepares the IAI to comprehend the nuances of the environment and facilitates informed decision-making. In our framework, the Perception component thus serves as the foundational interface between multifaceted data inputs and the IAI's cognitive mechanisms, ensuring that the system's responses are grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the environmental context.



{\bf Brain: }The Brain is the central component of the IAI system, functioning in a three-unit structure: database, storage, and decision-making. The RAG database contains a wealth of searchable academic texts, such as those pertaining to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), wireless power transfer (WPT), and more, as its training dataset. This corpus of knowledge is transformed into text embeddings that are stored within the IAI's knowledge base.  For the decision-making, the system adopts a plug-in architecture for selecting the appropriate LLM, such as GPT 4, LLAMA 2, Gemini, and Bloom.   When the database unit and the decision-making unit are combined, they form the RAG module. RAG allows the brain to infer, learn, retrieve, and reason, combining its capabilities with database resources to plan and execute actions to provide appropriate strategies for generating problems. For the storage, it is a repository of the agent's historical observations, thoughts, and actions. It enables the agent to effectively recall and apply previous strategies when tackling complex reasoning tasks, similar to how humans draw on memory to navigate unfamiliar situations. The Brain's architecture is integral to the IAI's learning process, providing a contextual understanding and the ability to utilize historical insights for informed decision-making, thereby enhancing the academic rigor of the system's cognitive process.




{\bf Action: }Within the IAI framework, the Action component responds to the Brain's directions and performs tasks in the network environment. This unit of the system follows a clear four-step method. It starts by analyzing network designer inputs, guided by the Brain's insights. Then, it pulls useful information from its knowledge base. Next, the module shapes the network problem into a clear mathematical form. The final step is to present the formulated optimization model. The Action module turns plans into real results, making sure that the IAI's decisions have a direct and practical impact on the network.


{\bf Environment: } The Environment component of the IAI framework is pivotal in encapsulating the application domain for the IAI agent's operation. It represents the real-world network scenarios as described by the network designer, forming the foundation for the IAI's problem formulation process. For instance, in a scenario where a network designer wants to formulate an optimization problem for a RIS-assisted SWIPT network with RSMA, the interaction begins with the network designer's initial request for assistance. The IAI agent then prompts the network designer for specific details, such as the system model, the optimization objective, the decision variables, and any necessary constraints. Through this iterative dialogue, the network designer provides the required information step-by-step. Then, the network designer might describe the network's configuration for optimizing EE, and the IAI agent will use its information to develop an appropriate optimization problem. This interactive process allows the IAI system to thoroughly understand the network designer-defined environment and generate an optimized problem model that aligns with the specific characteristics and requirements of the network scenario. It showcases how the Environment component acts as a collaborative stage, integrating network designer inputs with IAI functionality to create tailored problem-solving approaches for complex network environments.

          The dynamic nature of the wireless environment presents a significant challenge, as the values of the channel gains, denoted as $\{g_1, ..., g_M\}$, can fluctuate within a range. Therefore, our objective is, <b>given a set of environmental variables as a condition, to use GDM to denoise the Gaussian noise into the corresponding optimal power allocation scheme under this condition.</b><br>
          Here, we consider $M= 100$. Specifically, the first 50 channels are in good quality and the last channels are in deep fadings.

      <p>
        <b>A</b>. Note that the power allocation problem we consider here is a highly simplified one. In such cases, the performance of GDM is not always superior to DRL. For more realistic optimization problems (such as decision problems involving state transitions), considering combining GDM with DRL could be worthwhile, as is explored in our <a href="https://github.com/Lizonghang/AGOD" target="_blank">D2SAC code</a> and paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13052" target="_blank">Generative AI-aided Optimization for AI-Generated Content (AIGC) Services in Edge Networks</a><br>
        <b>B</b>. The relationship between GDMs and DRL in intelligent network optimization is not just the substitution or competition but rather a compliment and/or supplement of each other that allows for mutual enhancement and learning. In situations where expert strategies are not available for guidance, GDM can leverage a solution evaluation network during the training phase. This is like the Q-network commonly used in DRL. The solution evaluation network estimates the quality of a given solution, e.g., the power allocation scheme in the discussed example, under specific environmental conditions. This quality assessment guides the GDM during its iterative denoising process. Moreover, other advanced techniques from the DRL field can be adopted to make GDM training even more efficient. For example, the double Q-learning technique, which aims at reducing over-estimation in Q-learning, can be adopted. This approach maintains two Q-networks, using the smaller Q-value for updates, thus offering a conservative estimate and mitigating over-optimistic solution assessments. Incorporating such methods can augment GDM training, promoting robustness and efficiency.
